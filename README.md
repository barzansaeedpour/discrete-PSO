# Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in Python

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in Python. Discrete PSO is a variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm that is designed for discrete optimization problems. This implementation is aimed at providing a simple yet powerful tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems.

## Features

- Python implementation of DPSO for discrete optimization problems.
- Customizable parameters for swarm size, maximum iterations, and problem-specific constraints.
- A clean and well-documented codebase suitable for educational and practical applications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
